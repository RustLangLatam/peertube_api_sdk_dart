## What is PeerTube?

[PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) is a decentralized, federated video hosting platform built on ActivityPub. It allows users to host their own video servers (instances) while enabling cross-instance interaction. PeerTube is an excellent alternative to centralized platforms like YouTube, offering:

- **Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure.
- **Federation**: Instances can interact with each other, creating a network of interconnected servers.
- **Privacy**: Users have control over their data and content.
- **Open Source**: PeerTube is free and open-source software.
